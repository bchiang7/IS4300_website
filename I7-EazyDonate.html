        <h3>Assignment 7: Heuristic Evaluation for EazyDonate<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;4/13/15</small></h3>

        <ol>
          <li>In the 'age' field of the sign up form, if you want the user to enter MM/DD/YYYY, shouldn't the label be 'birthday' instead? This is just a cosmetic severity, it shouldn't be detrimental to your application in any way.</li>

          <li>In the sign up form, the 'password' and 'confirm password' fields copied everything I typed in the 'email' field (and vice versa).  You should edit the functionality of these fields so that you can type in each field separately.  This is probably of minor severity (I'm assuming that a user's email address shouldn't be identical to their password).  Filling in each field should be an affordance you should give your users.</li>

          <li>Overall, I thought completing task 1 was very easy and straight forward, just keep in mind the comments above when further developing the prototype.</li>
          <li>I thought the layout of the front page/home page was pretty clear and easy to navigate, however, maybe you should specify why the current charities are on the home page.  A label somewhere saying 'most popular' or something would indicate why those charities are being displayed front and center on the home page.  Also, the text of the last two UNICEF panels on the home page should have the same margins as the paragraphs above.</li>
          <li>This is also linked to the 'Charities' panel on the right.  Are the charities listed on this panel every single charity in EasyDonate's system?  It should probably be more specific for the sake of clarity.</li>
          <li>Also concerning browsing, when clicking on the categories panel on the left to search for charities, I think that the categories sidebar should still appear when clicking on a category.  To indicate which category is being searched, maybe highlight that link (class="active") or specify at the top what category is being searched.</li>
          <li>Other than what I said above, I thought the overall layout of the homepage was good and browsing for an educational charity was straight forward.  Maybe when there are more charities added to EazyDonate, you could incorporate sorting features, maybe by alphabetical order or popularity or something like that.</li>
          <li>I was not able to complete task three because I was not able to find the link for habitat for humanity.  This is of major severity to your project because it is an essential and task for the concept of EazyDonate.  I figured that because this is a first prototype, you guys probably didn't have time to include a link to the Habitat for Humanity page.</li>
          <li>Despite the fact that I was not able to find the Habitat for Humanity page for me to donate to, I was able to find several pages for WHO, and the donate functionality works well.</li>
          <li>Maybe you guys could incorporate (or make it look like) there is some more security when donating.  Entering my credit card number and information into a form and not knowing where it goes can be sketchy.</li>
          <li>You could include a payment confirmation page or fake send a notification or confirmation email of the transaction.</li>
          <li>Overall, your prototype was pretty good, just make sure the design of all your content is consistent and to give the user feedback of what they are searching for (i.e. charity category, sort by, etc.).  Also, I know you used bootstrap, but I'm sure with more development EazyDonate could aesthetically look much better.</li>
