        <h3>"Social Annotations in Web Search" Critique<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;3/30/15</small></h3>

        <p>Read the CHI article <a href="https://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/is4300sp15/ssl/SocialSearchAnnotations.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>The research goal presented in this paper was to understand how social annotations affect user behavior during web searches.  By 'social annotations' they referred to the social signals, or any social information that is used to affect ranking, recommendations, or presentation to the user, as explanations why a search or recommendations result is being displayed.  Jennifer Fernquist and Ed Chi conducted a study involving an eye tracking mix method using real life traffic search engines like Google.  As the internet, which facilitates social media, becomes increasingly social, more and more information signals come from social sources.  Users expect to be able to search for socially-sourced information as well as expect to have social information accessible in their casual browsing of the web.</p>

        <p>There has been previous research studying the ways social signals affect web search, there has been a significantly less amount of work dedicated to how users can and will make use of social annotations to make decisions during their searches on the internet.  To focus their research, Fernquist and Chi focused on three hypotheses: (1) First, they wanted to identify how the visual design of social annotations affects the probability of users fixating on the annotation and how frequently.  (2) Second, they were interested in whether subjects learned to look at social annotations more over the hour-long experiment, given its potential usefulness.  (3) Third, they wanted to identify and categorize types of tasks and queries that are conducive to annotations or recommendation explanations for search queries.</p>

        <p>I think Fernquist and Chi's research was very interesting.  Their use of eye tracking technology was a good way to effectively and accurately measure and observe the way users behave, consciously and subconsciously during typical web searches.  This method also allowed them to gather information that they wouldn't have had if they had just asked users questions after web searches or asked their subjects to talk aloud during their web searches.  Most people don't pay that much attention to the way their eyes move across a page when they are reading.  Most of the time, people's eyes don't move line by line.  They scan different sections of the paper, and fixate on different things depending on if it is interesting to them.  For example, people may fixate longer on pictures or icons than they would on a long portion of text.  Also, since reading comes so naturally and quickly for people, it would be harder for them to express their exact stream of consciousness while reading.  I also think that this kind of research could improve the user experience of searching the web.  With the integration of more social features, I think web searches and the experience of decision making during these searches can be greatly enhanced, given the right situation.  Sometimes it could be incredibly useful, while other times it could be incredibly annoying.  The challenge is to know when it is appropriate and when it is not.</p>
        
        <p>I think one thing that they could have improved was their subject pool.  Understandably, both Fernquist and Chi are both Google employees, and most people nowadays use google as their primary search engine, it's still limiting their research if they want to find a way to use social annotations in web searching in general.  They recruited 12 subjects that were active Google+ users.  Since Google+ isn't as popular as say, Facebook, I feel like this could have made some of their research biased.  Although Google is the main search engine on the internet and will probably be forever, it is not fair to rule out other search engines and other social networks that could be integrated into these searches.</p>
