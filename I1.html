		<h3>Assignment 1: Project Brainstorming<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;1/15/15</small></h3>

        <p><b>Pick three different project ideas that you would be interested in working on, make a rough sketch of a user interface (a scanned or photographed sketch on paper is best) and write a 1 paragraph proposal for each, further fleshing out the idea. Post your write-ups and sketches on a web page in your order of preference (these will be used to help form project teams).</b></p>

        <p>For the first idea, I was thinking of making a traffic tracker/sandwich ordering app for a popular cafe on campus called Rebecca's.  Since the food at Rebecca's is great, there's always a rush during lunch time and breakfast times.  And because Rebecca's is not a very big place, it becomes a mad house of students trying to squeeze their way through various food lines to get to the register and then find a place to sit.  To track how busy it is in Rebecca's, you could use the number of meal swipes that have been used in the past hour or so.  Based on how large that number is, there could be a scale or spectrum (perhaps with green being empty and red being very busy) to indicate the traffic currently at rebecca's. Another functionality of this app could be an ordering service.  Since standing on line for food is part of the reason Rebecca's gets so packed, expediting this by ordering food before you actually get there could be beneficial.  I have a few sketches for this on paper.</p>

        <p>My second idea was something called PrinterView.  In the campus dorms, there is a service called LaundryView.  Basically it is a website where you can see a virtual layout of the laundry room of your respective dorm on campus.  You can see which machines are being used and which are available.  You can also track how much time is left in a cycle if a machine is being used.  Since some printers on campus are often out of service, printerview would have a live status of all the printers.  Basically it would be a webpage similar to laundryview, but of a full map of Northeastern's campus and each printer at its respective location.  To indicate if the printer is working or out of service, there could be a green or red indicator on each printer.  This would be an interactive map, with zooming functionalities, etc.</p>

        <p>For my third idea, I was thinking of making an interactive planner.  I have used several different online planners/apps and I haven't been completely satisfied with any of them.  This student planner would keep track of a class schedule, different tasks in a to-do list form, a calendar to visually see when assignments are due, and a home page that cleanly shows all tasks/classes/exams of the current date.</p>
