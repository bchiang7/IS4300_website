        <h3>"Scenario-Based Interactive UI Design" Critique<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;2/23/15</small></h3>

        <p>Read the CHI article <a href="https://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/is4300sp15/ssl/scenariotool.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>Analyzing and considering user behavior has been an essential requirement in successfully designing interactive technology.    However, covering every single possible user scenario with one user interface can be a tough task.  In the paper Scenario-Based Interactive UI Design, the authors highlight two key weaknesses of using scenarios to create better user interfaces.  First, integrating several scenarios in one UI is a difficult task, even if you can come up with every possible scenario.  Second, maintaining a relationship between scenarios and UI is also not easy, especially in an iterative .  They present a tool called the Scenario-based Interactive UI Design Tool to solve the existing problems through a hierarchical scenario structure and visualized overview of scenarios.  It is designed to support the characterization of user behavior based on scenarios and then using the information in UI design.  </p>
        <p>Scenarios describe how people do and complete tasks.  They are great tools to use for eliciting user requirements and making sure a product meets the needs of its end users.  Even if you don't have the design skills of a graphic designer, taking into account the different use cases of your stakeholders when designing software will make for better usability.  However, there may be hundreds of scenarios that are more complex than the generic user.  This makes managing scenarios a difficult task especially when requirements change.</p>
        <p>Before the Scenario-based Interactive UI Design Tool, there was no tool that supports the need of designers to oversee and understand scenarios easily when designing UI.  The tool thus particularly focuses on managing scenarios and visualizing the relationships among multiple scenarios.  It does this by allowing the designer to reorder sentences in scenarios and create a hierarchical structure.  It also maintains links among sentences, tags, visualization, and UI.  Furthermore, it adds traceability between scenarios and UI so that the designer can be efficient with each iteration of the product.</p>

        <p><br>I thought the Scenario-based Interaction UI Design Tool (although its name is a mouthful) offered a simple, elegant way of organizing the links between various scenarios and the implementation of the UI that corresponded with different user behaviors.  As seen in the image above, the hierarchical structure of the sentences in the scenarios provides a great way of visualizing the requirements expected of each user.  Moreover, the color-coated tags offer a flexible, easily traceable solution to keeping track of different elements of UI.  I also thought that the juxtaposition of the scenario editor and the UI Editor gives the UI more visual and mental fluidity.  It's a major advantage that the designer is able to smoothly switch between the two editors depending on their situation.</p>
        <p>I don't think there was anything I didn't like about this tool or the article.  I had never thought about having a tool or application that combined both writing scenarios and creating user interface elements.  I always pictured scenario writing and eliciting requirements were just preparation steps to actually creating successful interfaces.  With the Scenario-based Interaction UI Design Tool, designers are able to combine these tasks in a way that is not overwhelming and maintains the relationships between scenarios and UI without being disruptive.</p>
        <p>With much evidence, the authors showed that it seamlessly integrates with an iterative design process as well as enables designers to concentrate on design tasks.  Any flaws in the UI could easily be corrected thanks to the traceability of requirements.  The Scenario-based Interactive UI Design Tool allows designers to focus on their designs and their iterative process rather than worrying about keeping track of many different user scenarios.  It is a great tool and I'd like to try it out some day.</p>
