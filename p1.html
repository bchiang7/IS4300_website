          <h5>Problem:</h5>
          <p>Most students’ and working adults’ lives are comprised of many different, ever-changing parts such as homework assignments, business meetings, tasks, class schedules, and so on. With today’s technology, many people try to organize all these different aspects of their lives using calendars and planners on various web sites and phone applications. However, while most of these sites and applications often do a good job of organizing tasks, events, assignments, or class schedules, they are usually geared toward one or the other and don’t easily and concisely encompass every aspect of people’s lives. For example, some applications are very good for managing tasks but are not meant to keep track of calendar events; other applications are very good at managing class schedules and assignments but don’t allow the user to track tasks or add other kinds of events to their calendar.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h5>Target Users:</h5>
          <p>This application will target users who are mainly students and working adults since they are usually ones with the most busy and complicated lives.</p>

        </li>

        <li>
          <h5>Solution:</h5>
          <p>This planner application will attempt to provide users with a clean, fluid user interface to keep track of and combine their class schedules, tasks, homework, business meetings, events and more in one central place. We have looked at several student planning/to-do list applications and determined what we think works and doesn’t work. We would like to have a calendar based application that will allow the user to add multiple types of events, such as a class or meeting, and see them in day, week, or month view. The user will also be able to add an assignment, project, or exam, and set a due date and reminder notification. And while the user is in week view or day view, these will be shown under the correct day of the week in a freeze-row-type section of the calendar at the bottom so that the user can scroll up and down through the calendar while always being able to see the assignments, projects, or exams at the bottom. While in Month view, the freeze-row-type section will change to show the all events, classes, and assignments of the day selected. The user will also be able to see a task list on the right hand side of the application. Once a task or assignment has been completed, the user will be able to check off or cross off the item. On the left hand side of the window, the user will be able to navigate the application using buttons. There will be at least an “add”  and a “remove” button for all tasks, assignments, events, or classes, a button for changing the calendar view, and help and search buttons. We also hope to be able to allow the user to sync this application with google calendar, as well as be able to share schedules with each other. For example, if someone creates a team practice schedule, they can share it with all the players and it will appear in everyone’s calendars alongside their own events.</p>

          <p>In order to avoid repeating the pitfalls of other applications and websites, we plan to create a survey for the class to gauge what kind of features typical college students would like and dislike, what they find the best way to organize their lives is, and what suggestions they have. Initially, we are aiming for a web-based application, but a mobile version is not out of the question. We are planning to develop the web application with HTML and CSS, and the mobile version potentially with Java. We envision this application to look something like this:</p>
