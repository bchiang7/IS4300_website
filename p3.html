        <h5><b>Activity Scenarios</b></h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h6><b>Adding an assignment/class</b></h6>
            <p>Berta is a first-year at Northeastern University. She has never had to manage classes and events before, as her parents kept track of those things for her. Her Professor, Professor Smith, does not use any kind of homework posting service (Blackboard, Piazza, class website), so she opens up Calendr, an innovative new web application that has been taking the internet by storm with its sleek and cutting-edge branding and design. Using Calendr, Berta is able to add in all of her classes just like would be able to on a paper calendar, but with Calendr, she’s able to specify the start and end dates of her semester, and the days each class meets, so every class meeting is added automatically without her having to manually edit them. Now, using the ‘plus’ button, and the drop-down menu that originates from it, she is able to quickly add her assignments to her various classes as they are given.  Every time she adds a new assignment, she can now see them in a list organized by due date, with the most urgent assignments first.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h6><b>Adding an event to the calendar</b></h6>
            <p>Clarence is a 24 year old medical student who is attached to his work, but also enjoys post-modern rock and roll. His daily commute takes him past a bulletin board on which many events and shows are posted. One day, Clarence notices a new band performing in Boston the following month.  He immediately remembers that he has the awesome app Calendr (recommended to him by his friend Berta) on his smartphone, so he whips out his phone at once and brings up the app. He taps the ‘plus’ button and chooses to add a quick event from the drop-down menu that opens. He plugs in the details into the app and hits the floppy-disk ‘save’ icon to save the event. When he goes past the bulletin board the next day, he finds that someone has ripped down the poster! It’s a good thing Clarence put in the data into his Calendr App! Smart thinking Clarence!</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h6><b>Adding a task to the to do list</b></h6>
            <p>Blanche, a third-year college student, uses Calendr to keep track of her classes and work study job schedule. She lives with three roommates who don't use any kind of scheduler or planner, so they are constantly forgetting about things like getting groceries, and Blanche must take care of it. Whenever her roommates pops her head out of her bedroom and asks Blanche to go to the store to pick up cookies, milk, and yogurt, Blanche knows that she will forget if she doesn’t add it to Calendr. She’s near her computer, so she goes to the Calendr web app to add a task by easily hitting the ‘plus’ button, selecting a Task, and adding in the information. Minutes later, her roommate notes that she made a mistake, and actually needs cookies, milk, and eggs, so Blanche jumps back on Calendr and hits the pencil button which denotes the ‘edit’ function to update the task. Just then, roommate number three pipes up and says that she already bought milk, so Blanche taps the ‘checkbox’ next to “milk” in her task list so that it now shows up as ‘completed.’ Good thing that Calendr has all these convenient functionalities!</b>
