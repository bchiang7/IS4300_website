        <h3>"Notes on Fridge Surfaces" Critique<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;1/26/15</small></h3>

        <p>Read the CHI article <a href="https://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/is4300sp15/ssl/swan05.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>This paper by Laurel Swan and Alex Taylor focused on the use and the organization of items on refrigerator surfaces.  The large physical design and central location of the fridge (usually in the kitchen) allows it to be a widely shared surface for all household members.  The routine use of the fridge to store and retrieve foods also means that its surfaces are seen by anyone who uses it on a daily basis.  This makes it a prime spot for displaying household schedules and reminders.  Since the fridge is located in such a common area, its unique surface affords the negotiation of family relations.  Each family member can allocate a certain region of the fridge for their own use.  For example, Mom and Dad might take up the upper left and right corners of the fridge, while the kids take up the lower half of the fridge (also due to their height).</p>

        <p>Swan also highlighted how fridge magnets are vital for the configurability and informality that makes fridges such a flexible tool for everyday use.  Magnets allow for easy and fluid interaction.  Things can be moved around from one spot of the fridge to another without any damage to other elements on the fridge.  Magnets do not have the permanence of tape and do not require the extra effort of piercing surfaces like thumbtacks require.  Thus, magnets lend themselves to being put on, taken off, or reconfigured on the fly, with minimal effort.  These are a few of the reasons why fridge surfaces are so successful in being utilized by everyone in the household.</p>

        <p>Swan and Taylor's research goal was to investigate and determine why refrigerator surfaces are such an integral part of home life, as well as identifying design features that allow for easier and more accessible interactive surfaces for the home.  I think that they did achieve their goal.  They brought up several crucial and important points that allow for the success of fridge surfaces, which I mentioned above.</p>

        <p>Some of the things I liked about their research was that they fully elaborated on each point they made.  Whether it was the physical design of the fridge surface, or how humans interact with it on a daily basis.  They brought up points about fridges that I had never thought about before.  They also made me think about my relationship with the fridge, both at home or at school.  I thought picking the fridge as a research topic to learn more about designing for the home was a great decision.  Despite the simplicity of the fridge, we can learn a lot about utilizing common spaces by studying one that is already successful.</p>

        <p>Some things that they could have improved on in their research was analyzing different scenarios or households.  I understand that the examples they presented in the article were there to support their points, but they never brought up the fridges of other kinds of households.  What if a household didn't involve kids?  What if someone lives alone?  I'm sure that their fridge surfaces would be different.  Although they didn't include as many examples, I thought Swan and Taylor's research was very interesting and thought-provoking.</p>
