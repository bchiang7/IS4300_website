        <h3>Assignment 2: UI Critique<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;1/22/15</small></h3>

        <b><p>Find 2 examples of good user interface design, and 2 examples of bad user interface design.</p></b>

      <h4>Good UI:</h4>

      <ol>
        <li><h5>Medium<h5></li>
        <p>Medium is an online blog-publishing platform founded by the co-founders of Twitter.  It has evolved into a hybrid of non-professional contributions and professional, paid contributions.  It is a kind of "social journalism" with a WYSIWYG user interface.</p>

        <p>Similar to Twitter, once an article is posted, it can be recommended and shared by users.  Writers and readers can also follow people as well as publications, which are collections of articles that have to do with a specific topic.</p>

        <p>The design of the overall user interface is both visually pleasing and easy to navigate.  It is simple and has clear visibility so it provides just the right information at a glance. This satisfies Nielsen's first design heuristic: simple and natural dialogue/aesthetic and minimalist design.</p>

        <img width="800" src="http://static.tumblr.com/d5odntq/9Kznijnri/medium.png"/>

        <p><br>Above is the home page. At a glance, there are three main sections: the header, the articles on the left panel, and the top stories on the right panel.  This layout is easy on the eyes and conveys all the important and relevant information without looking too busy.</p>

        <p>The header provides easy access to shortcuts that lead to certain categories and the Medium logo always returns you to the homepage.  (Nielsen's 6th and 7th heuristics)</p>

        <p>One of my favorite features of the main article section is that with each article, they tell you how long ago it was posted as well as how long of a read it is.  This satisfies Nielsen's third design heuristic: minimize user memory load / recognition rather than recall</p>

        <img width="400" src="http://static.tumblr.com/d5odntq/0Rznijnw3/medium_2.png"/>

        <p><br>Particularly, a few other features I enjoy about medium are the big graphics that make reading more engaging and the ability for readers to leave the author comments and notes on certain parts of the article, not just the end. (Here is a gratuitous example of a gif of Tina Fey giving the middle finger as well as a comment on the right side.)</p>

        <img width="700" src="http://static.tumblr.com/d5odntq/Mkinijnxj/medium_4.png"/>

        <p><br>The side comments allow for reader and authors alike to see exactly where in the article commenters are referring to, rather than having to scroll back up to tediously find a particular line or spot.</p>

        <p>Finally, Medium has a FAQ page accessible through the footer on the right panel.  And if your question isn't in the FAQ, you can email or tweet them.</p>

        <img width="700" src="http://static.tumblr.com/d5odntq/vcnnijnyf/medium_5.png"/>

        <br><br>

        <li><h5>Google Drive</h5></li>

        <p>Google Drive is a file hosting and storage service offered by Google that provides cloud storage, file sharing, and collaborative editing.  It includes Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, which is a browser-based office suite that allows collaborative editing of documents, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings, forms, and more.  In addition to Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, Google Drive supports many other file types such as image, video, audio, and text files as well as PDFs.</p>

        <p>Google Drive meets practically all of Nielsen's design heuristics.  The main page of Google Drive, as seen below is fairly simple.  It has a header, with a few buttons on the right, a left panel with different categories, a main panel with all the content on your drive, and a togglable right panel which shows any recent activity or details.</p>

        <img width="800" src="http://static.tumblr.com/d5odntq/BA8nijo2v/drive_2.png"/>

        <p><br>Just by looking at the main page of Google Drive, we can see that it meets Heuristic 1, 2, and 3.  It is a simple, minimalistic design, it uses concise language that everyone can understand, such as "incoming", "recent", "activity", etc.  The UI also minimizes user memory load by clearly displaying all information in a logical pattern.</p>

        <div class="small-block-grid-2">
          <img width="300" src="http://static.tumblr.com/d5odntq/Y24nijo8l/drive_phone.png"/>
          <img width="400" src="http://static.tumblr.com/d5odntq/rjFnijo96/drive_ipad.png"/>
        </div>

        <p><br>As seen above, Google Drive also satisfies heuristic 4.  The screenshot on the left is Google Drive for iPhone and on the right for iPad.  The user interface is consistent across devices.</p>

        <p>Google Drive also fulfills heuristic 5-- especially in the browser, when an item is clickable, it becomes highlighted or underlined  when the cursor hovers over it.</p>

        <img width="300" src="http://static.tumblr.com/d5odntq/fGhnijoaa/drive_3.png"/>

        <p><br>Heuristic 6 and 7 are also covered.  The user has much freedom to alter or edit whatever files or folders in the drive.  One can do this by right clicking on an item or selecting the item and then performing an action on it by clicking the buttons near the top.</p>

        <img width="500" src="http://static.tumblr.com/d5odntq/85hnijobm/drive_4.png"/>

        <p><br>Finally, users are able to search through their files using the search bar at the top of the page.  Also if they need help, there is the option to search for the topic you need by clicking the help option on the settings button dropdown menu. This satisfies heuristic 10.</p>

      </ol>

      <br>

      <h4>Bad UI:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><h5>myNEU</h5></li>

        <p>myNEU is the student portal for Northeastern University.  It is the online resource for important information and services such as class registration, ticket purchasing, paying tuition, checking husky card balances, space scheduling, applying for co-ops, and much more.</p>

        <p>myNEU has five main tabs: myNEU Central, Self Service, Community, Experiential Learning/Co-op,  Career Development, and InfoChannels.</p>

        <img width="800" src="http://static.tumblr.com/d5odntq/GnVnijoec/myneu.png"/>

        <p><br>The most navigated and most frustrating tab is the Self Service tab as seen above.  By just glancing at the page, it clearly violates Nielsen's first heuristic.  It is basically the opposite of minimalist design.  Some have described it as "text vomit".   There is just so much text and information on one page that it is simply easier and more time effective to use CTRL+F to search for the link you're looking for.  The visibility of information is just so cluttered that it might as well be one long list of links.  This shouldn't be the case.</p>

        <p>Currently, the links are organized into many different modules.  These modules have headings titles such as "My Information", "Registrar", "Study and Course Resources", "Student Financial Services", etc.  However, there are different numbers of links in each module, the modules are all different sizes.  Since each module comes one right after another, it makes the page look extremely cluttered and unorganized.</p>

        <p>Given that there are many necessary and very important links on myNEU, it is valid that there is so much text on each page.  However, all this information can be organized in a much simpler way to actually minimize user memory load (Heuristic 3)</p>

        <p>First off, the heading titles such as "Registrar" and "Study and Course Resources" could be increased in size so they stand out more.  Second, there could be more tabs to divide up the information and services in a more coherent way.  Instead of stuffing everything into the self services tab, there could be more tabs.  For example, a tab for financial services and payments, a tab for technology resources and software downloads, and another for the registrar. </p>

        <p>Another annoyance of myNEU is that every link opens in a new window.  This becomes extremely tedious and bothersome when one wants to open several links at once.  This limits user control and freedom (Heuristic 6)</p>

        <img width="800" src="http://static.tumblr.com/d5odntq/8c6nijofo/myneu_2.png"/>

        <p><br>In my opinion myNEU needs to have a complete overhaul, however I understand that Northeastern gets this web platform from SunGard.  The problems I mentioned above are only a few of the many annoyances myNEU brings.  If I were to redesign myNEU, I would give it a clean, easy to navigate user interface with clearer, more distinct sections to make information more accessible.</p>

        <br>


        <li><h5>iProcrastinate</h5></li>

        <p>iProcrastinate is a task manager for Mac and iOS. It is a planner app that allows you to keep track of your homework assignments, projects, chores, and miscellaneous tasks.</p>

        <img width="700" src="http://static.tumblr.com/d5odntq/zVjnijohi/iproc.png"/>
        <br><br>
        <p><br>For the most part, I think iProcrastinate's user interface is pretty good.  It is very straight forward.  In the main center panel you have all your tasks.  The left sidebar has different groups which allow you to filter your tasks into specific categories, such as tasks that are due today, upcoming, or overdue tasks.  iProcrastinate also allows you to create subjects to categorize your tasks by class or activity.</p>

        <p>My main pet peeve with iProcrastinate are the '+' and '-' buttons at the bottom of the window and the bottom of the main task panel.  The plus and minus buttons in the leftmost corner allows the user to add subjects or delete objects.  The plus and minus buttons on the main panel allows the user to add tasks or delete tasks.  I often confused the two sets of buttons, accidentally creating a new subject when I wanted to create a task, or vice versa.</p>

        <img width="250" src="http://static.tumblr.com/d5odntq/3sbnijoj6/iproc_2.png"/>


        <p><br>This conflicts with Nielsen's 7th heuristic.  Adding a new subject or adding a new task should be marked differently.  For the sake of clarity and minimizing error.  In addition, I do not think the minus button is necessary.  At first, users don't realize that it is the delete button.  Instead, I think it would be better to have a delete option (like a trashcan icon while hovering) on each subject or task.  Instead of having to select and delete, it is more straight forward to have the option right on the specific subject or task.</p>

        <p>Moreover, another bad design that I found with iProcrastinate is the edit function.  To edit a task or a subject, the user must double click for the editing box to show up.  A better solution for this would be to have a edit option (like a pen icon while hovering) on each subject or task.  This is more inherent for users to learn.  These features would make iProcrastinate a much better application.</p>
