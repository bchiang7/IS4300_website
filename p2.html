        <ol>
          <li>
            <h5>Title: Calendr</h5>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h5>Problem</h5>
            <p>Most calendars/planners are disconnected and do not have the option of integrating different tasks into one place.  This planner application will provide users with a clean, fluid user interface to keep track of and combine their schedule, tasks, homework, and more in one central place.  Instead of having multiple applications, calendars, and to-do lists to keep track of your life, this all-in-one application will do it all.</p>

          </li>

          <li>
            <h5>Users</h5>
            <p>Our primary stakeholders are students, particularly college students.  These college students would typically be taking a full course load (four classes) and living on their own.  This requires them to run errands, which includes grocery shopping, cleaning, and other tasks.  If they are involved in extracurriculars, they might have different club meetings on several different days of the week.  In addition to being in school, they might also be working a part-time job which adds more complexity to their busy schedules.</p>

            <p>We set up this survey and so far a few people have filled it out.  We're planning on emailing the survey to the whole class to do it.</p>

            <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1acx7eVPtF0-jr9vsq_Wip0Na7Js3WObtHsVE9DvR_Rw/viewform" target="_blank">Calendr Survey</a></p>

            <p>So far, this is what we gathered from the results:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Most people do use a calendar application (mainly Google Calendar or Courseoff)</li>
              <li>Most users prefer convenience and simplicity (i.e. having it sync to their phones/easy to use interface)</li>
              <li>Most people do not use a to do list application, they just remember it in their head</li>
              <li>For assignments/tests, most people just use a notebook to keep track of it.</li>

            </ul>

            <h5>Problem Scenarios</h5>
            <h6>Adding an assignment/class</h6>
            <p>Berta is a first-year at Northeastern University. She has never had to manage classes and events before, as her parents kept track of those things for her. She uses Google Calendar to add her classes as soon as her course schedule is established. Her Professor, Professor Smith, does not use any kind of homework posting service (Blackboard, Piazza, class website), so Sally has been writing down her assignments in a text document on her computer. She wishes she could add her assignments under her classes on her calendar.</p>

            <h6>Adding an event to the calendar</h6>
            <p>Clarence is a 24 year old medical student who is attached to his work, but also enjoys post-modern rock and roll. His daily commute takes him past a bulletin board on which many events and shows are posted. One day, Clarence notices a new band performing in Boston the following month. He makes a mental note of this, but by the time he gets to his home to mark it on his fridge calendar, he's forgotten the date, time, and venue! When he goes back to the bulletin board, he finds to his horror that someone has ripped down the poster! Clarence wishes there was some way he could add events to a calendar from his mobile.</p>

            <h6>Adding a task to the to do list</h6>
            <p>Blanche, a third-year college student, uses a calendar to keep track of her classes and work study job schedule. Unfortunately, she lives with three roommates who don't use any kind of scheduler or planner, so they are constantly forgetting about things like getting groceries, and Blanche must take care of it. She currently keeps track of her tasks by a built-in app on her smartphone, but she wishes there was some way she could consolidate all of her schedules and to-do list.</b>
