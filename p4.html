        <h5><b>Interaction Scenarios</b></h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h6><b>Adding an assignment/class</b></h6>
            <p>Berta is a first-year at Northeastern University. She has never had to manage classes and events before, as her parents kept track of those things for her. Her Professor, Professor Smith, does not use any kind of homework posting service (Blackboard, Piazza, class website), so she opens pulls up Calendr to input her assignments. She logs in to the website with her username and password, then after scanning the Dashboard for any upcoming tasks and finding none, she proceeds to the Assignment view. She clicks the Add button, and chooses to add a new Course. She inputs the Professor’s name, the location, meeting days, and time, as well as the start and end dates of her semester. Then she goes ahead and confirms the new Course to be added. Now, she clicks the Add button in the sidebar again and opts to add a new Assignment. She plugs in her assignment, selects the Course it is for, and marks the due-date. She confirms adding the assignment, and it immediately shows up in her Assignments view. Now, when she clicks back to the Dashboard, she sees the assignment she just added in the Upcoming Assignments list.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h6><b>Adding an event to the calendar</b></h6>
            <p>Clarence is a 24 year old medical student who is attached to his work, but also enjoys post-modern rock and roll. His daily commute takes him past a bulletin board on which many events and shows are posted. One day, Clarence notices a new band performing in Boston the following month. He immediately remembers that he has the awesome app Calendr (recommended to him by his friend Berta) on his smartphone, so he whips out his phone at once and brings up the app. He quickly logs in to Calendr at the login screen, then is brought to his Calendr Dashboard. On the Dashboard, he procedes to the Events section and hits the Add button in the Events panel. A dialogue pops up, prompting him to input the name of the event, the date, and the time. He puts in this information, then confirms the Event. It gets added to his Calendr, and appears in his upcoming events section on the Dashboard. Now with the Event stored, Clarence closes the app and continues on his way home.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h6><b>Adding a task to the to do list</b></h6>
            <p>Blanche, a third-year college student, uses Calendr to keep track of her classes and work study job schedule. She lives with three roommates who don't use any kind of scheduler or planner, so they are constantly forgetting about things like getting groceries, and Blanche must take care of it. Whenever her roommates pops her head out of her bedroom and asks Blanche to go to the store to pick up cookies, milk, and yogurt, Blanche knows that she will forget if she doesn’t add it to Calendr. She logs in on the login page, then goes to her dashboard, and after scanning the upcoming events, etc, she sees that groceries aren’t currently in her Tasks list. But to be sure, she goes to the Tasks section by hitting the button in the sidebar, and goes through the full list without seeing it. So she clicks the “Add another” link on the bottom of the Tasks list, and enters “cookies”. Now the Task is visible on her Dashboard and in the Tasks view. She repeats the step for adding a task item for both “milk” and “yogurt.” Minutes later, her roommate notes that she made a mistake, and actually needs cookies, milk, and eggs, so Blanche goes back on Calendr and deletes “yogurt” from the list (when she hovers over a task item, a little ‘x’ appears next to it to delete it). Then she clicks “add another” at the bottom of the list and types in “eggs.” Just then, roommate number three pipes up and says that she already bought milk, so Blanche clicks the checkbox next to “milk” in her task list so that it now shows up as completed.</b>

        <h5><b>Design Options</b></h5>

        <p>Our most important window would be the calendar view, given our app is called Calendr.</p>

        <p>Option 1</p>
        <img src="http://static.tumblr.com/d5odntq/0RUnkpwse/mockup.png"/>

        <p><br>Option 2</p>
        <img src="http://static.tumblr.com/d5odntq/6rdnkpwu3/screen_shot_2015-03-04_at_9.15.53_pm.png"/>

        <p><br>Option 3</p>
        <img src="http://static.tumblr.com/d5odntq/yrenkpwuj/screen_shot_2015-03-04_at_9.16.09_pm.png"/>

        <p><br>We decided to go with the first option because we felt that having the navigation bar on the left side is the most natural and widely accepted (at least in western countries).  Also, having the columns extend to the bottom frozen sections makes the screen look very crowded.  We decided that it would be best to keep it simple and avoid clutter.</p>

        <br>

        <h5><b>Overall Design</b></h5>

        <p><b>Login Page</b>: Where users go to log in to their Calendr account.</p>

        <p><br><b>Dashboard</b>: Home page of Calendr, a snapshot of the current day where you can see the day's events, upcoming assignments due, and tasks.</p>
        <img src="http://static.tumblr.com/d5odntq/FV2nkpx78/screen_shot_2015-03-04_at_9.46.43_pm.png"/>

        <p><br><b>Calendar View</b>: The calendar with weekly and monthly views as well as the task list.</p>
        <img src="http://static.tumblr.com/d5odntq/0RUnkpwse/mockup.png"/>

        <p><br><b>Assignment/Class View</b>: A way to view all your courses and assignments.</p>
