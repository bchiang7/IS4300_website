        <h3>Assignment 3: Ethnography<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;2/9/15</small></h3>

        <p>After coming to Northeastern last year, I quickly realized that the process of swiping in and signing in to the on-campus dorms is incredibly inefficient annoying.  For each dorm, there is a proctor at the front desk 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Every person who comes into the dorm is required to swipe in every time they enter the building.  What is especially aggravating is the process of signing in people who do not live in that dorm.  After living in two on-campus dorms at Northeastern so far, I have noticed that this process has frustrated many, if not all Northeastern students, including me.</p>

        <p>The process of entering a dorm that you are a resident of is somewhat bothersome, although not very difficult.  The lobby and the actual residential areas are usually separated by a locked door.  When you enter the building, you hand your husky card to the proctor at the proctor desk who then swipes the card.  (Sometimes there is a line if the proctor isn't being very efficient or if class just let out and a lot of people are coming back home.)  After the proctor swipes the card, the light on the card reader then either turns red or green.  When the light turns green, this indicates that the person trying to enter the dorm indeed is a resident.  The proctor then presses the button to open the locked door.</p>

        <p>This process becomes infinitely more annoying and tedious when you have people who do not live in the dorm visiting.  For this process, the proctor must take the ID cards of all guests and manually hand write their information onto a log.  Signing in people who aren't residents of a dorm is also restricted to 5 people on weekdays and 3 people on weekends.  The artifacts of this entire process includes a pen, paper, multiple identifications, a card reader, and the button behind the proctor's desk that opens the door.Â </p>

        <p>After spending around 30 minutes (from 3:00-3:30) on Friday, February 6th in the lobby of the dorm I currently live in, Willis Hall, I was able to observed several of the people going in and out of the building.  I realized that there are two different perspectives and groups of people to observe for the sign-in process.  The students use the system and the proctor manually operates it.  The people who use this system must consist of a Northeastern student who lives at the dorm and up to 3 or 5 people who have a form of identification.  The Northeastern student is usually 19 or 20 years old, sometimes older since it's an upperclassmen dorm.  The proctor is generally a graduate student between 22 to 30.  Sometimes the proctor is an RA of the dorm, because they are required to do at least on proctoring shift every week.</p>

        <p>On Fridays there's a class that lets out at 3:15, so at around 3:20, there was an increase of people coming in.  The surge of people caused a line to form reaching from the proctor's desk to the door.  I immediately noticed the frustration of some students, especially some students who had been in line for a few minutes.  I could tell that students were annoyed by the sign-in process, especially when a line formed and students in front of them were signing in people.  The proctor also seemed annoyed, especially when there was a lot of people to sign in.  Having to manually log every person who is signed in is a tedious and obsolete task.</p>

        <p>The students and proctors that I interviewed about the sign in process unanimously agreed that it was both outdated and tedious.  They expressed the same frustration and annoyance about this process.  One male student I interviewed wondered why Northeastern didn't do what other schools do, take away the proctor and simply have card readers mounted to the wall.  He stated, "proctors just slow everything down, if we could swipe the cards ourselves we wouldn't have to wait in a line".  Another female student I interviewed understood that the process was tedious in order to keep the dorm safe, but still expressed that "it's so stupid" and "signing people in should be on a computer, not paper".  The proctor that I interviewed at the time also expressed that the work is very boring and that students often get angry at proctors when it is the process that is actually the aggravating issue.</p>

        <p>I understand that it is necessary to keep this logging system in case of any incidents as well as the safety of everyone in the building.  I think an easy solution to this would be to keep security guards at the entrances of each dorm, however, to expedite swiping in, all Northeastern students should get access to all Northeastern dorms.  Instead of having to have proctor to swipe the card, there should just be a card reader mounted to the wall.  To access the building, all students would need to do is swipe their ID cards.  If a student wants to sign in a person who doesn't go to Northeastern, there should be a computer to log this information.  This would significantly decrease waiting times and waste less time.  The security guard would just be there for signing people in and general security.</p>

        <p>Overall, everyone I interviewed agreed that Northeastern's sign-in process was very frustrating.  After many years, this process has not been updated, and it continues to cause frustration for both students and proctors.  This process could be expedited by a computer and mounted swipe system, however, I expect that it would cost the university a large amount of money and a decrease in student employment.  Through this study, I learned that the sign-in process is frustrating, but it is there to ensure the safety of everyone.</p>
