        <h3>P5b: Paper Prototype Evaluation<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;3/30/15</small></h3>
        <br>
        <h5><b>Briefing</b></h5>

        <p>We are in the process of designing a brand-new calendar and scheduling web application, with an additional focus on school courses and assignments. You can interact with it much like you would interact with calendar programs you may have used in the past.</p>

        <p>We are conducting a study to see how people interact with this new web application, which is currently called Calendr. This is for a course we are taking at Northeastern called Human-Computer Interaction with Professor Sprague in the College of Computer and Information Science. Your participation is voluntary and you can stop at any time and ask that your data not be used. The total study should take about 10 to 15 minutes. Do you understand and agree to participate in this study?</p>

        <p>The purpose of today’s session is for you to help us figure out how to make Calendr’s interface more user-friendly and intuitive before we finish developing. Since we have not yet produced a finished product on the computer, we have created paper versions of Calendr’s interface. You can interact with this paper prototype just as you would a computer, and Logan will act as our computer and simulate interactive components. </p>

        <p>We will present you with three different tasks to complete, and your goal is to try to complete them using the interface, while speaking aloud any questions, comments, or concerns (if something is confusing or doesn’t make sense, tell us!) While you do this, the other members of the team will be watching and quietly taking notes.</p>

        <p>The prototype is still being developed, so there are some rough edges. You may find that components are missing or incomplete. We want to get some feedback about how well the design works before we start working on a finished product.</p>

        <p>As I mentioned, Logan will be playing the role of the computer. He won’t be able to talk- and cannot explain anything. If you want to do something, you’ll need to interact with the prototype. Use your finger to click on buttons. If you need to write something, you can use this pencil as your keyboard. It is perfectly fine to write on the prototype.</p>

        <p>Please tell us what makes sense to you, what’s confusing, and any questions that come to your mind. Your questions are especially valuable, but I might not answer them right away, as our goal is to change the interface so it answers them.</p>

        <p>Remember that we’re testing the interface- we’re not testing you. Are you ready to begin?</p>

        <br>

        <h5><b>Scenario Tasks</b></h5>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h6>“Add an event to your calendar that takes place this month on the 23rd.”</h6>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h6>“You’ve just finished ‘Task 6’ so you are ready to check that off. You have a new task that you need to add.”</h6>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h6>“Add a new assignment for the new class you’ve been taking.”</h6>
          </li>

        </ol>

        <br>

        <h5><b>Demographic</b></h5>
        <p>The participants that we used for the paper prototype testing consisted of 3 Northeastern sophomores currently taking classes.</p>

        <br>

        <h5><b>Description of Test Scenario</b></h5>
        <p>We tested participants on March 28th from around 4-5pm in a dorm room living room. We used a coffee table as a surface to work on and, other than the paper prototype, the only other equipment we used was laptops on which to take notes and observations.</p>

        <br>

        <h5><b>Observations</b></h5>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Prototype Problems</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>When a participant tried to eliminate a task using the task sidebar, the “computer” was forced to send them to the task page because we did not have a part of the paper prototype that would represent a completed task in the task sidebar</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>In the assignments page, assignments are already shown so it seems like there are already courses even though the third scenario task requires the participant to create a new course as if there are no courses already created.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>We did not have a part of the prototype that shows the new assignment that is added</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Instructions for adding assignment in scenario task three seemed to confuse the participants because by saying, “...for the new class you’ve been taking.” participants thought they were supposed to do something special to add a class first</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>We should have specified exactly what we wanted the participants to add, such as specific names and dates, so that we could show the correct result of the task (i.e. “Add an event called ‘Meeting’ to your calendar that takes place on March 23rd from 3 to 5 pm.”)</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>We should have specified that participants should assume that they already have an account for the login page; some participants tried to create a new account.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>We needed to make sure that we consistently said “class” or “course” and not interchanged them</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

          <li><b>Application Problems</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Participants did not seem to notice the plus button at the bottom left corner of the screen so we should move it up to the top of the list of icons in the upper left corner to the screen</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>We should have a “completed tasks” section in the task sidebar in order to maintain consistency with the task page</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>The icons proved to be a bit ambiguous so in order to fix that, we could either have a text label for each icon, make a tooltip with the name of the icon, and/or modify the icons to be clearer</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

        </ul>

        <br>

        <h5><b>Interview Notes</b></h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Participant 1</li>
            <ul>
              <li>confused on how to make events- she ended up clicking the add button!</li>
              <li>'class' and 'course' need to be consistent</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Participant 2</li>
            <ul>
              <li>suggestion: add plus button to each panel on the dashboard</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Participant 3</li>
            <ul>
              <li>task list in calendar view doesn’t have to take you to task view</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <br>


        <h5><b>Results</b></h5>
        <p>Time to complete all 3 tasks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Participant 1 = 8:37</li>
          <li>Participant 2 = 6:12</li>
          <li>Participant 3 = 6:49</li>
        </ul>
