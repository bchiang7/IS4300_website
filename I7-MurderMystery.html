        <h3>Assignment 7: Heuristic Evaluation for Murder Mystery App<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;4/13/15</small></h3>

        <ol>
          <li>The first task was easy and straight forward, and I thought that the existing template was very useful and well organized.</li>
          <li>After reading Task 2a, I was expecting Task 2b to be somehow more related to 2a, but I guess that was just my opinion.</li>
          <li>The timeline screen for task 2a confused me a little bit.  First of all, shouldn't a the times on a timeline go from earliest to latest?</li>
          <li>In addition, I wasn't sure what the timeline for Task 2 had to do with the security clearance code for Task 2b.</li>
          <li>I thought the paw icon at the top was not the clearest choice for 'Evidence'.  In retrospect, the paw was probably the best icon you could find in the font awesome icons.  I just wanted to bring up that it took me a while and more than a few clicks to find the security code amongst all the icons at the top.</li>
          <li>For Task 2b, when I had to trade the security code with Thibault, I was a little hesitant to click the 'share' button at the bottom of the security code page.  I think a more appropriate label for it would be 'trade' or 'use' or something like that.</li>
          <li>After clicking share, it was good that it took me to the guest list, but for future reference maybe it would be better to create another identical page, but rather with the title and instructions of how to trade your code with one of the guests.</li>
          <li>Completing Task 3 was very easy, as Thibault was the only guest with a link to his profile.  (In a real life situation I'm assuming the user will have more knowledge and context as to why Thibault should be accused)</li>
          <li>I know that all of this is very hypothetical, but I think that overall, your interface was easy to use and looked good on mobile.  However, it seemed very task oriented for this class.  If it was made into a real thing, it should probably have more instructions on the app so people know where to go and what the sequence of things are.</li>
          <li>Related to what I said above, the timeline was kind of confusing for me.  How was it supposed to help me figure out who murdered the mayor?</li>
          <li>I think this app has a lot of potential, and since it was made with bootstrap, I'm sure it could look more clean with more customization.</li>
          <li>Overall, I think that this web app could have been easier to navigate, which could probably be fixed by not focusing on what the tasks are, but rather focusing on what the user wants to do next and providing easy access to the evidence (maybe a dashboard? Or better icons?) to make it easy to see what the user should be thinking about to figure out who is the murderer.</li>
