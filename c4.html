        <h3>"White Rooms and Morphing Don't Mix" Critique<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;3/19/15</small></h3>

        <p>Read the CHI article <a href="https://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/is4300sp15/ssl/p111-reilly.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>The research goal for this paper was to illustrate how a specific map visualization technique was sensitive to the physical setting.  In previous research, the impact of factors other than basic visual perception and visualization techniques have been has been studied, however, there has  been no substantial work dedicated toward researching how physical settings affect the effectiveness of people's cognitive processes while using different information visualization techniques.  In order to focus more on this topic, the researchers at Dalhousie University conducted a study involving 120 participants in which they compared the effectiveness of two different geovisualization techniques, map morphing and juxtaposition, in two different settings--a white room (lab room) and a busy gathering space.  Participants were given two maps of London; one was a tourist map and one was a subway map.  Without being informed that they would be asked to recall information on the maps, the participants were given time to familiarize themselves with the two types of interfaces in the two different settings.  The results showed that those who did the best were those using the morphing interface in the casual, noisy gathering space, as well as those who used the juxtaposition interface in the quiet white room.</p>

        <p>I thought the research that they conducted at Dalhousie was very interesting and that their findings are helpful for those who are seeking the ways to most effectively use different interfaces.  Although their experiments were not incredibly standardized or precisely executed, their focus was to determine if there are actually significant recall differences between the techniques of morphing and juxtaposing for real life information, and they did achieve that.  They were able to discover that it was easier for people to recall information using the map morphing  technique when they were in a noisier, more casual setting while it was easier to recall information from the juxtaposition technique when participants were in a quiet, focused room.  The results from this study definitely showed how setting can impact the effectiveness of an interactive visualization technique, regardless of ecological validity.  It also proved that the technique of juxtaposition, and other techniques which require more cognitive capacity are better processed in a "white room" quiet space, while other techniques like the interactive map morphing technique are processed more easily in a less formal, noisy environment.</p>

        <p>One of the downsides to this research is that their experiments were not extensively tested.  They did acknowledge that their study did not attempt to achieve a high level of external validity.  In their different setting scenarios, they also did not make an effort to regulate how much distraction was taking place while the participants were studying the maps.  This could have caused fluctuations in the data which they did not account for.  Overall, I thought that the findings of the study were an interesting and could be applicable in accounting for user experiences in interfaces such as the map morphing, but it also seemed too lenient of an experiment to seriously prove that their findings were concrete.  One more thing that made me iffy about this paper was that sometimes the structure of the writing seemed to be repetitive and made it difficult for the reader to clearly understand the main point.  Often I found myself stopping after a few paragraphs, and trying to figure out if they were trying to analyze the morphing techniques or the actually effects of the setting on the efficiency of the morphing techniques.  If the writers had been more concise, I would have enjoyed reading this paper more.</p>
